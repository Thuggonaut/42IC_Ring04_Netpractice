🧐 ***What do I check when one host cannot communicate with another?***
1. Confirm IP configuration:
	- Ensure both hosts have valid IP addresses in the same subnet:
		- IPv4 addresses consist of four octets separated by dots (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)
		- Each octet should be a number between `0` and `255`
		- Adjust the invalid octet:
			- Change only the invalid octet to a number between `1` and `254`.
			- Avoid using `0` (network address) and `255` (broadcast address) in the last octet.
		- Check that the first three octets match for devices that should communicate directly (assuming a /24 subnet mask).
2. Verify subnet masks are correct
	- All devices on the same subnet should use the same subnet mask
	- No invalid patterns:
		- Avoid masks like `255.255.0.255 `(non-contiguous 1s and 0s)
3. Check for IP conflicts:
	- Ensure no duplicate IP addresses exist on the network

- Example 1:
```bash
****** Goal ID 1 ********
forward way : A -> B (104.99.23.12)
on A : packet accepted
on A: destination does not match any interface. pass through routing table
on A: destination does not match any route
******* Goal ID 2 ********
forward way : C -> D (211.190.200.42)
on C : packet accepted
on C: destination does not match any interface. pass through routing table
on C: destination does not match any route
```

Goal ID 1:
-  A1 and B1 are on different subnets

Goal ID 2:
-  C1 and D1 are on different subnets

```bash
******* Goal ID 1 ********
forward way : A -> B (104.99.23.12)
on A : packet accepted
on A: send to A1
on B : packet accepted
on B: destination IP reached
reverse way : B -> A (104.99.23.100)
on B : packet accepted
on B: send to B1
on A : packet accepted
on A: destination IP reached
******* Goal ID 2 ********
forward way : C -> D (211.191.232.42)
on C : packet accepted
on C: send to C1
on D : packet accepted
on D: destination IP reached
reverse way : D -> C (211.191.232.75)
on D : packet accepted
on D: send to D1
on C : packet accepted
on C: destination IP reached
