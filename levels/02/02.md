🧐 ***What does it mean when mask is /30?***
- When a subnet mask is specified as `/30`, it refers to a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation that indicates the number of bits used for the network portion of the IP address:
	- Binary representation:
		- A `/30` mask in binary is `11111111.11111111.11111111.11111100`
		- This equates to `255.255.255.252` in decimal notation
	- Network and host portions:
		- 30 bits are used for the network portion
		- The remaining 2 bits are used for host addresses and can be changed to create different addresses within the same network.
- A `/30` subnet is the smallest practical subnet for IPv4
	- It's often used to conserve IP addresses in network designs

```bash
******* Goal ID 1 ********
forward way : B -> A (192.168.108.1)
on B : packet accepted
on B: destination does not match any interface. pass through routing table
on B: destination does not match any route
******* Goal ID 1 ********
loopback address detected on outside interface
on inerface C1: invalid IP
```

Goal 1 (B to A communication):
- The subnet mask `255.255.255.224` is a `/27` subnet, which means:
	- Network bits: `27`
	- Host bits: `5`
- `192.168.108.1` (A1) and `192.168.108.222` (B1) are not in the same `/27` subnet.
- The subnet `192.168.108.192/27` ranges from `192.168.108.193` to `192.168.108.222`
- `192.168.108.193` is the first usable IP in this subnet

🧐 ***How is the range calculated?***
- Subnet mask `/27` in binary:
	- `11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000`
	- `255.255.255.224` in decimal
	- This means the last octet has 3 network bits and 5 host bits.
		- `32 total bits - 27 network bits = 5 bits` left for the host portion.
	- Possible values for the last octet of the network address:
		- `0, 32, 64, 96, 128, 160, 192, 224`
		- `192.168.108.222` falls into the `192.168.108.192` network
		- First usable IP: `192.168.108.193` (network address + 1)
		- Last usable IP: `192.168.108.222` (broadcast address - 1)

Goal 2 (D to C communication):
- The issue here is that they're using loopback addresses (`127.x.x.x`).
- We need to change these to valid IP addresses to move away from the loopback address:
	- The `10.0.0.0/30` subnet is a small network segment that uses the private IP address range.
	- Available addresses:
		- `10.0.0.0` - Network address (not usable)
		- `10.0.0.1` - First usable IP
		-` 10.0.0.2` - Second usable IP

🧐 ***What is a loopback address?***
- A loopback address is an IP address that is used to represent the local machine on a network.
- It's often used to test network connections and services on the local machine.
- Most common: `127.0.0.1` (IPv4) and `::1` (IPv6).
- Alias: Often referred to as "localhost".
