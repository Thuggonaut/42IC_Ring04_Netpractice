üßê ***What is the CIDR notation?***
- CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing IP packets. 
- It uses a format that combines an IP address with a suffix indicating the number of bits in the subnet mask.
- For example, in the CIDR notation `192.168.1.0/24`:
	- `192.168.1.0` is the IP address.
	- `/24` indicates that the first 24 bits are the network part of the address, leaving the remaining bits for host addresses.

üßê ***How do I calculate the usuable IP range, dependent on the subnet mask suffix?***
1. Calculate the number of host bits: 
	- Subtract the CIDR suffix from `32` (the total number of bits in an IPv4 address). 
	- For example, for `/24`, the number of host bits is `32 - 24 = 8`.
2. Determine the number of addresses: 
	- The number of possible addresses is `2^host_bits`. 
	- For `8` host bits, this is `2^8 = 256`.
3. Identify the network address: 
	- The 4th octet of the network address is the starting point. 
	- For example, in `192.168.1.0/24`, the 4th octet is `0`.
4. Calculate the range: 
	- The range of the 4th octet is from the network address to the broadcast address. 
	- The broadcast address is the last address in the range, which is calculated as `network_address + (number_of_addresses - 1)`.
		- For `/24`:
		- Network address: `192.168.1.0` (min)
		- Broadcast address: `192.168.1.255` (max)
		- Range of the 4th octet: `0` to `255`

- Example:
	- For `/24`: Range is `0 - 255` (2^8 - 1)
	- For `/25`: Range is `0 - 127` (2^7 - 1)
	- For `/26`: Range is `0 - 63`	(2^6 - 1)
	- For `/27`: Range is `0 - 31`	(2^5 - 1)
	- For `/28`: Range is `0 - 15`	(2^4 - 1)
	- For `/29`: Range is `0 - 7`	(2^3 - 1)
	- For `/30`: Range is `0 - 3`	(2^2 - 1)

5. For usable IP addresses:
	- First usuable IP: 4th octet of `network address - 1`
	- Last usable IP: `number_of_address - 1` 

üßê ***How do I convert a suffix into a decimal subnet mask?***
- To convert a CIDR notation `/x` into a decimal subnet mask:
	1. `x` indicates how many bits are used for the network part of the address.
	2. The subnet mask is a `32-bit` number where the first `x` bits are set to `1` and the remaining `32 - x` bits are set to `0`.
	3. Split the 32-bit binary number into four 8-bit octets and convert each octet to decimal.
- Example: convert `/23`:
	- Binary representation: /23 means the first 23 bits are 1s:
		`11111111.11111111.11111110.00000000`
	- Convert to decimal:
		`11111111 = 255`
		`11111111 = 255`
		`11111110 = 254`
		`00000000 = 0`
	- Result: The decimal subnet mask for `/23` is `255.255.254.0.`


```bash
******* Goal ID 2 ********
forward way : A -> C (104.198.245.254)
on A : packet accepted
on A: destination does not match any interface. pass through routing table
on A: destination does not match any route
******* Goal ID 3 ********
forward way : B -> C (104.198.245.254)
on B : packet accepted
on B: destination does not match any interface. pass through routing table
on B: destination does not match any route
```

- A, B, and C are devices on the network using a `/25` subnet mask (`255.255.255.128`)
- With a `/25` mask, we have two subnets:
	- `104.198.245.0 - 104.198.245.127` (A and B are in this subnet)
	- `104.198.245.128 - 104.198.245.255` (C is in this subnet)

- The problem is, both A and B are trying to reach C (`104.198.245.254`)
- Neither A nor B can route to C because they're in different subnets.
- We need to move C to the same subnet as A and B.

üßê ***What is an inter-subnet communication?***
- Inter-subnet communication is the process of sending packets between devices on different subnets.

```bash
******* Goal ID 1 ********
forward way : A -> B (104.198.245.42)
on A : packet accepted
on A: send to A1
on switch S: pass to all connections
on C : packet not for me
on A : loop detected
on B : packet accepted
on B: destination IP reached
reverse way : B -> A (104.198.245.125)
on B : packet accepted
on B: send to B1
on switch S: pass to all connections
on C : packet not for me
on A : packet accepted
on A: destination IP reached
on B : loop detected
******* Goal ID 2 ********

üßê ***What does "packet not for me" mean?***
- It means that the packet is not for the device that received it.
- **Packet routing:**
	- When a device receives a packet, it first checks if the packet is intended for itself.
	- It does this by comparing the packet's destination IP with its own IP addresses.
	- If the packet is not for the device, it is dropped.
- In many network configurations, seeing packets "not for me" is normal and doesn't necessarily indicate a problem.
