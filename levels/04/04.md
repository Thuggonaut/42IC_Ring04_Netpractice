# Networking components

🧐 ***Host?***
- Definition: 
	- A host is any device that connects to a network and can send or receive data. This includes computers, servers, smartphones, and IoT devices.
- Function: 
	- Hosts are endpoints in a network that utilize network resources and services.

🧐 ***Switch?***
- Definition: 
	- A switch is a networking device that connects multiple devices within a local area network (LAN).
- Function: 
	- It uses MAC (Media Access Control) addresses to forward data only to the intended recipient device, improving network efficiency. Switches operate at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model.

🧐 ***Router?***
- Definition: 
	- A router is a device that connects different networks, such as a local network to the internet.
- Function: 
	- It routes data packets between networks based on IP addresses, making decisions about the best path for data to travel. Routers operate at Layer 3 (Network Layer) of the OSI model. 

🧐 ***What are the interfaces of a router?***
- A router typically has multiple interfaces, which can vary based on the router's design and purpose. 
- Here are some common types of interfaces found on routers:
	- **WAN Interfaces:** 
		- Connect the router to external networks, such as the internet. 
		- This can include Ethernet ports, fiber optic connections, or DSL interfaces.
	- **LAN Interfaces:** 
		- Connect the router to local area networks (LANs). 
		- These are usually Ethernet ports for connecting devices like computers and switches.
	- **Wireless Interfaces:** 
		- For routers with Wi-Fi capabilities, these interfaces allow wireless devices to connect to the network.
- All interfaces on a router typically have an IP address and a subnet mask assigned to them.

- B1 IP is not in the same subnet as R1
	- Subnet Mask:` 255.255.255.192` (or `/26`) allows for 64 IP addresses in the subnet (from `63.31.114.128` to `63.31.114.191`).
	- The valid host IPs in this range are from `63.31.114.129` to `63.31.114.190`.
