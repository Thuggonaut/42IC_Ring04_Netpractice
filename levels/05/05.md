🧐 ***What is a default route?***
- A default route (often represented as 0.0.0.0/0) is a catch-all route that is used when no other specific route matches the destination IP address of a packet.
- It directs traffic to a specified gateway (usually a router) for any destination that is not explicitly defined in the routing table. 
	- This is essential for reaching external networks or the internet.
- The `=>` specifies the next-hop IP address (gateway) that a Host should use to reach the default (or specified) network. 


```bash
******* Goal ID 1 ********
forward way : A -> R (23.223.30.126)
on A : packet accepted
on A: destination does not match any interface. pass through routing table
invalid route on host A
on A: destination does not match any route
forward way : A -> R (167.169.101.254)
on A : packet accepted
on A: destination does not match any interface. pass through routing table
invalid route on host A
on A: destination does not match any route
******* Goal ID 2 ********
forward way : B -> R (23.223.30.126)
on B : packet accepted
on B: destination does not match any interface. pass through routing table
on B : route match default
on B : route match but no interface for gateway 192.168.0.254
forward way : B -> R (167.169.101.254)
on B : packet accepted
on B: destination does not match any interface. pass through routing table
on B : route match default
on B : route match but no interface for gateway 192.168.0.254
******* Goal ID 3 ********
forward way : A -> B (192.168.42.42)
on A : packet accepted
on A: destination does not match any interface. pass through routing table
invalid route on host A
on A: destination does not match any route
```

1. Routes:
	- Change the default route to point to the router's interface IPs.
	- Update the route to ensure it can reach the router.
2. Interface Configuration:
	- Change the IP address and mask to be in the same subnet as the router's interfaces.
3. A needs to match R1, and B needs to match R2
