🧐 ***Why does a routher have two (or more) interfaces?***
- If a router has two single interfaces, they are typically referred to as:
1. WAN Interface (Wide Area Network): This interface connects the router to an external network, such as the internet or another remote network. It is used for outbound and inbound traffic to and from the wider network.
2. LAN Interface (Local Area Network): This interface connects the router to a local network, allowing devices within that network to communicate with each other and access the WAN. It is used for internal traffic among local devices.
These interfaces allow the router to manage traffic between the local network and external networks effectively.

```bash
******* Goal ID 1 ********
forward way : A -> Somewhere on the Net (8.8.8.8)
on A : packet accepted
on A: destination does not match any interface. pass through routing table
on A : route match 0.0.0.0/0
on A: send to gateway 41.86.31.1 through interface A1
on switch S: pass to all connections
on R : packet not for me
on A : loop detected
```
Communication Flow
1. From Host A to the Internet:
	- Host A sends packets to its default gateway (41.86.31.1).
	- Router R receives the packets and checks its routing table.
	- If configured correctly, Router R forwards the packets to the Internet.
2. Potential Issues:
	- If Router R does not have a route to the Internet or if Host A's default route is incorrect, communication will fail.
	- A loop detected message indicates that packets are being sent back and forth without reaching their destination, often due to misconfigured routes.


1. Routing Issues: The route for Host A was updated to point to the correct gateway (41.86.31.226 instead of 41.86.31.1), ensuring that packets are sent to the correct router interface.
Interface IP Addressing: The IP address of interface R1 was changed from 41.86.31.254 to 41.86.31.226, which aligns with the new routing configuration and prevents conflicts.
2. Subnet Mask Adjustments: The subnet mask for the route from Host A was adjusted to /25, which allows for a larger range of IP addresses, ensuring proper communication with the router.
4. Default Route for Router R: The router R's routing table was simplified to a default route, allowing it to forward packets to the Internet without needing specific routes for every destination.
