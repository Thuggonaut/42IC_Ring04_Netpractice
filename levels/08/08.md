- A router's destination and next-hop addresses depend on the specific routing scenario. Generally:
- Destination Address: 
	- This is the IP address of the final destination device or network that the router is trying to reach. 
	- It could be a specific device's IP or the network address of a subnet.
- Next-Hop Address: 
	- This is the IP address of the next router or gateway that the packet should be sent to on its way to the destination. 
	- It is typically the IP address of the router that is directly connected to the current router.
- In a routing table, you would see entries like:
	- Destination: 192.168.1.0/24 (indicating the network)
	- Next-Hop: 192.168.1.1 (the router's IP address on the same network)

- Internet I:
	- Routes:
		- 141.39.189.0/26 indicates a network address with a subnet mask of 26 bits. 
			- This means the network includes IP addresses from 141.39.189.0 to 141.39.189.63.
		- => 163.234.250.12 indicates that packets destined for the 141.39.189.0/26 network should be sent to the next-hop IP address 163.234.250.12.

- Router R1 (gate.non-real.com):
	- Routes:
		- 141.39.189.0/26 => 141.39.189.61 means that for the same network, packets should be sent to the next-hop IP address 141.39.189.61.
		- 0.0.0.0/0 => 163.234.250.1 indicates a default route. This means that any packets not matching a more specific route should be sent to 163.234.250.1. The 0.0.0.0/0 notation represents all possible IP addresses.
